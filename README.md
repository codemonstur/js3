# js3 - a client for accessing Amazon S3 / Minio

The official Amazon SDK for accessing S3 has many dependencies and weighs about 10MB.

For something as simple as talking to an external HTTP API and uploading and downloading some files I felt that this was too heavy.

The code in this library is based on pico-s3 but has been heavy refactored and extended to allow for additional features.
